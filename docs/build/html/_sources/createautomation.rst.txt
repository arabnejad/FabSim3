.. _createautomation:

This document briefly details how user/developers can create their own FabSim3 automations.

Overview
========
* Automation scripts allow user/developers to create their own FabSim3 functionalities. They are usually created and modified within individual plugins.
* Base automation scripts reside within the ``base/`` subdirectory. These should normally not be modified, but they can serve as examples to create your own functionalities, or as building blocks to create complex functions.
* Plugin-specific automation scripts reside within the base directory of the respective plugin. The script that will be invoked by default is ``<plugin_name>.py``. For larger plugins, various other Python scripts can of course be imported in this main script.

How to write automation functions
=================================
* All automation functions are written using Python 3.
* On top of that, they rely on shorthand functionalities as provided by Fabric3. See `documentation <http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.14/usage/tasks.html>`_ for more information.
* Commands to be run on the local client side are called using ``local()``.
* Commands to be run remotely are called using ``run()``.

Examples
========
To access a remote resource and scan available modules for a specific name one could write::

  @task
  def probe(label="undefined"):
    """ Scans a remote site for the presence of certain software. """
  return run("module avail 2>&1 | grep %s" % label)

This task can then be invoked on the archer supercomputer to search for LAMMPS modules by using ::

    fab archer probe:label=lammps

To run an arbitrary bash script locally one could write::

  @task
  def blackbox(script='test.sh', args=''):
      """ Black-box script execution. """
      for p in env.local_blackbox_path:
          script_file_path = os.path.join(p, script)
          if os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(script_file_path)):
              local("%s %s" % (script_file_path, args))
  return

.. note:: This function first navigates to the ``blackbox/`` subdirectory in the local Fabsim3 installation, and subsequently executes the ``$script`` in that directory. Also, the freehand use of ``args`` give a sequence of parameters etc.


To run LAMMPS on a remote host (part of FabMD) one could write::

  @task
  def lammps(config,**args):
      """Submit a LAMMPS job to the remote queue.
      The job results will be stored with a name pattern as defined in the environment,
      e.g. cylinder-abcd1234-legion-256
      config : config directory to use to define geometry, e.g. config=cylinder
      Keyword arguments:
              cores : number of compute cores to request
              images : number of images to take
              steering : steering session i.d.
              wall_time : wall-time job limit
              memory : memory per node
      """
      update_environment(args)
      with_config(config)
      execute(put_configs,config)
      job(dict(script='lammps', wall_time='0:15:0', memory='2G'),args)

* The combination of ``**args`` in the declaration with ``update_environment(args)`` at the start of the function allows users to specify arbitrary arguments on the command line, and to have those automatically loaded in to the FabSim3 environment.
* ``with_config()`` loads in input files into FabSim3.
* ``execute(put_configs,config)`` copies the configuration information to the right directory at the remote resource.
* On the last line, LAMMPS is run remotely (shown by `script='lammps'`), and the values of ``args`` are passed on to that function as well, overriding the default **wall_time** and memory specification on that line if the user has specified those variables explicitly already.

Accessing FabSim commands from Python scripts
---------------------------------------------

To launch FabSim3 commands from Python scripts, we have established a basic Python API. This file can be found `here <https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3/blob/master/lib/fabsim3_cmd_api.py>`_.

We recommend using this API rather than ``os.system()`` or ``subprocess()`` directly, as it will allow us to fix any emerging bugs in future versions for you.
