This document briefly details how user/developers can setup a remote machine on FabSim3 for job submission.

Overview
========
The aim of FabSim3 is to automate and simplify the creation, management, execution and modification of complex application workflows, using functionalities such as ensemble runs, remote executions and code couplings. This helps researchers to become more productive in general, and more effective with handling complex applications in particular. For instance, researchers may want to run and rerun static configurations, run a range of slightly different workflows, or to define new types of complex applications altogether.


FabSim3 is built on top of the `Python Fabric library <http://www.fabfile.org/>`__, and therefore shares automation and remote access features with Fabric (http://www.fabfile.org) and other system-level automation tools such as Ansible (http://www.ansible.com) and Homebrew (http://brew.sh).
