For FabSim3, we provide several interactive tutorials, as well as static tutorials.

The interactive tutorials use Jupyter notebooks, and they can be found [here](https://github.com/vecma-project/VECMA-tutorials/tree/master/FabSim3).


## How to use `fabsim` API commands from python code

Within FabSim3, in addition to `fabsim` command APIs, we also provide this functionality to call `fabsim` commands from a python code. The best example that showcases how to do this is [FabUQCampaign](https://github.com/wedeling/FabUQCampaign).


## Advanced Plugins Examples

For more advanced examples, please see the plugins available in the `fabsim/deploy/plugins.yml` file. Both [FabFlee](https://github.com/djgroen/FabFlee), and [FabMD](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/FabMD) are good examples that showcase the possibilities of FabSim3.
