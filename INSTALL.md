Installing and Testing FabSim
======

This document describes how to install FabSim3 and perform basic tests. The full and most up-to-date documentation is available at http://fabsim3.readthedocs.io or in docs/index.rst (locally).

## Dependencies

To use FabSim3, you will need to have git installed, as FabSim3 requires git to install plugins.

### The "pip" way
FabSim requires the following Python modules:
* PyYAML (any version) 
* fabric3 (1.1.13.post1 has worked for us)
* numpy

You can install using `pip3 install PyYAML`, `pip3 install numpy` and `pip3 install fabric3`.

To perform the Py.test tests (not required for using FabSim, but essential for running the tests), you will need `pytest` and `pytest-pep8`.

### Using apt on Ubuntu (tried with 18.04 Bionic Beaver)
(when using a server version, make sure you add `universe` at the end of the first line of `/etc/apt/sources.list`)
* `sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client` (if you want to run jobs on localhost)
* `sudo apt install git`
* `sudo apt install python3-yaml`
* `sudo apt install python3-numpy`
* `sudo apt install python3-pip`
* `sudo apt install python3-pytest-pep8` (this will also install py.test for Python3)
* go to the `fabric3_base` subdirectory.
* run `pip3 install Fabric3-1.14.post1-py3-none-any.whl`

**Note for Mac users**
> For Mac users, you might also need ssh-copy-id. This can be installed using `brew install ssh-copy-id`.



## Installing FabSim3

1. Clone the code from the GitHub repository.

2. Ensure that the main FabSim3 directory is in your $PYTHONPATH environment variable and that the `fabsim` command can be launched from the command line. An easy way to accomplish this is by adding the following to the end of your $HOME/.bashrc file:
```
export PATH=(path of your FabSim3 directory)/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=(path of your FabSim3 directory):$PYTHONPATH
```
Note that you may have to restart the shell for these changes to apply.

3. Copy `machines_user_example.yml` in the `deploy/` subdirectory to `machines_user.yml`. Modify its contents so that it matches with your local settings. For first (local) testing, one must change the settings under the sections `default:` and `localhost:` so as to update the paths of FabSim directory and lammps executable respectively. 

**Note for Mac Users**
> For Mac Users, be sure to override the default home directory, 
> by switching the `home_path_template` variable by uncommenting the following line: 
> `home_path_template: "/Users/$username`

4. To enable use of FabSim on your local host, type `fab localhost setup_fabsim`. 
   - As part of this command, you will be logging in to your own machine through SSH once, which can trigger a password prompt. In this case, simply type the password for the machine in which you are running these commands.
   
**Note for Mac Users**
> For Mac Users, change`runtime_path_template:"$home_path"` to `runtime_path_template:"~"`in the `deploy/machines.yml`.    

5. To enable use of FabSim on any other remote machine, make sure that (a) machines.yml contains the specific details of the remote machine, and (b) machines_user.yml contains the specific information for your user account and home directory for the machine. After that, simply type 'fab <machine_name> setup_fabsim'.

* NOTE: FabSim commands can now be launched using the `fabsim` command. Note that some older tutorials might use `fab` commands instead of `fabsim`. If `fabsim` command is not found, simply add PATH and PYTHONPATH (step 2) to `~/.bash_profile`, as well as set environment for Python3 in the `bin/fabsim` by replacing `#!/usr/bin/python3` to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. The two commands can be used interchangably, although the `fabsim` command gives clearer outputs and can be launched from anywhere (`fab` can only be used within the FabSim installation directories). 

### Installing plugins

By default, FabSim3 comes with the FabMD plugin installed. Other plugins can be installed, and are listed in deploy/plugins.yml.

To install a specific plugin, simply type: `fabsim localhost install_plugin:<plug_name>`

To create your own plugin, please refer to doc/CreatingPlugins.md

### Updating 

If you have already installed FabSim and want to update to the latest version, in your local FabSim directory simply type `git pull`. Your personal settings like the `machines_user.yml` will be unchanged by this.

To update plugins you will have to `git pull` from within each plugin directory as and when required.

## Testing FabSim

The easiest way to test FabSim is to simply go to the base directory of your FabSim installation and try the examples below.

Note: Mac users may get a `ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused` error. This means you must enable remote login. This is done in `System Preferences > Sharing > Remote Login`.

### List available commands.
1. Simply type `fabsim -l`.

### FabDummy testing on the local host
####  Installation
Simply type `fabsim localhost install_plugin:FabDummy` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory. `FabDummy` plugin will be downloaded under `<fabsim home folder>/plugins/FabDummy` 
####  Testing
1. To run a dummy job, type `fabsim localhost dummy:dummy_test`
2. To run an ensemble of dummy jobs, type `fabsim localhost dummy_ensemble:dummy_test`
3. for both cases, i.e., a single dummy job or an ensemble of dummy jobs, you can fetch the results by using `fabsim localhost fetch_results`

For more advanced testing features, please refer to the FabDummy tutorial at https://github.com/djgroen/FabDummy/blob/master/README.md.

### LAMMPS testing on the local host

1. Install LAMMPS (see http://lammps.sandia.gov for detailed download and installation instructions).
2. Modify `machines_user.yml` to make the `lammps_exec` variable point to the location of the LAMMPS executable. e.g., `lammps_exec: "/home/james/bin/lmp_serial"`.
3. FabSim contains sample LAMMPS input files, so there's no need to download that.
4. (first time use only) Create the required FabSim directory using the following command: `fabsim localhost setup_fabsim`.
5. Before run LAMMPS test data set, you should install FabMD which provides functionality to extend FabSim3's workflow and remote submission capabilities to LAMMPS specific tasks. Please install it by typing
`fabsim localhost install_plugin:FabMD`
6. Run the LAMMPS test data set using: `fabsim localhost lammps_dummy:lammps_dummy,cores=1,wall_time=1:00:0`.
7. Run `fabsim localhost fetch_results` to copy the output of your job in the results directory. By default this will be a subdirectory in `~/FabSim/results`.

### Creating the relevant FabSim directories on a local or remote host

1. Ensure that you have modified `machines_user.yml` to contain correct information for your target machine.

### Auto bash-completion for fabsim

To enable this option, please run `source fabsim-completion.bash` on your FabSim3 directory, or you can add
```
source (path of your FabSim3 directory)/fabsim-completion.bash
```
into your `$HOME/.bashrc` file to have enable it everytime that the shell is activated.
